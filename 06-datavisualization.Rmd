# Data Visualization  

A major part of Data Literacy is visualization. The main form which this is done is through the making of graphs. There are many graphs that are possible based on the comparison you wish to make. 

The main point of this section is to help guide you for which plots you can make.

## Types of Graphs

Here is a small little review of some of the graphs talked about in WFC 70 and when they may be useful.

Remember that the general code to generate graphs is:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = "dataname",
  mapping = aes(x = "x-variable", y = "y-variable")) +
  geom_"graphtype"() 
```

Where "dataname" is the name of your dataset, x-variable and y-variable are the chosen columns for compariso (ex. length, weight, sex) and "graphtype" being one of the possible graphs from below (ex. geom_violin, geom_point,etc.)

### Histogram

A histogram is useful when comparing one categorical factor with values. For histograms, you can play with bin width and alpha (transparency).

### Violin Plot

A violin plot is a great way to visualize distribution of a sample, especially with seeing the variation present. It is a great way to visualize data if you feel as though a box plot does not truly convey the variation in your numeric values.

### Box Plot

A box plot is a more uniformed way to visualize and display your data. This is most effective when there is a grand difference between the comparisons. If the box plots are too similar, then it can be more effective to utilize a violin plot.

### Scatter Plot

A scatter plot plots each value as an individual point. It is useful when you have two numerical values as your x-value and y-value. It is also possible to plot multiple categorical values and have them represented through color.

## Making Pretty Graphs

You are able edit and add certain aspects to your graph to make them clearer. These include colors, labels and themes.



## Extra Resources 

Here are some extra resources for different graphs you can make and some introductory materials!

https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/ggplot2.html ← Introductory to ggplot2

https://r-graph-gallery.com/ ← Collection of R studio examples! A good resource because the graphs are sorted by what type of graphs that are

https://r-graph-gallery.com/ggplot2-package.html ← ggplot! Shows the different possibilities with ggplot, including annotation, labels, and titles
