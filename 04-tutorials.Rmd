# Code not Working?

People make mistakes. It is a common process in coding that everyone, no just beginners experience. Here we will provide some tips if you make a mistake and provide tutorials for some potential complicated concepts.

## Checklist

There are some common mistakes people often overlook which cause the code not to work. If your code is not working, here are some things to double check:

1.  Check Spelling
    -   Does all your spelling match? Is the data you are referencing spelled ***exactly*** the same? For example, "cats" is not the same as "Cats".
2.  Reread Code
