# Getting Started {-}

Before we begin, it is recommended that you make a folder in your Google Drive and/or desktop on your personal computer, to keep your files. You may find Google Drive to be more effective due to it being able to be connected to multiple devices. 

## Installing R and R Studio

A program you will hopefully become familiar with is R and R Studio. Lecture and lab discusses the differences between these two.

R is the language you are using to create the graphs. R Studio is where you input the code. One way to think about it is that R Studio is the kitchen and R represents all your ingredients.

We will need both on your computer before your first lab. Even if you are not going to be bringing your personal computer to lab, having it can be helpful for homework and the Data Story.

Once you have successfully downloaded both, don't be afraid to open R Studio and play around!

## Tips for Getting Started With Labs

A main component of WFC70 are the labs. The labs will be where you get to really practice the skills of data literacy. In lab, you will work within Rmarkdown files which allow you to insert code chunks while also simply writing. Lab rmds will be available to download in the files section of Canvas. 


## Tips for Working From Home

As expected, most homework assignments will be completed at home also through Rmd files. At times, you will need to refer back to lab material to help accomplish the homework assignments, including the Data Story. Navigating things at home may be difficult, especially if you are utilizing your personal computer. This is why it is important to play around and get familiar with the R Studio workspace.

## Shortcuts

There are lots of helpful keyboard shortcuts available to increase your workflow, not only for coding, but in general. Below is a link to a guide of shortcuts and their use, created by fellow Learning Assistant Zoe Smith.
