# Lab 2: Indicies in R, R Markdown

In this lab, we will do a small amount of R programming, learn how to write 
reproducible analyses using R Markdown, and get started on skills to read 
primary literature. 

By the end of this lab, you should be able to:

* use indices and data frame column names to select particular pieces of 
data,
* edit an R Markdown file to integrate text and code and change the document 
style,
* knit an R Markdown file.


## Part 0: Figure of the week (5-10 minutes, instructor leading)

## Part 1: R vs. RStudio, .R vs. .Rmd files (5 minutes, instructor leading)

### R vs. RStudio

This short section has some clarifications about the programs we are use.
You are using the programming language R. That is the primary skill you are 
developing in these labs. But the program we open to write our R code is called 
RStudio. RStudio is known as an IDE (an *integrated development environment*), 
which is a fancy way to say that it is a useful program in which to write and 
run your R code. So, on a future CV, say that you are proficient in R (and, 
soon enough, R Markdown). You don't have to explicitly mention RStudio.

This raises another issue that throws people off at the start. ***Always begin
your programming sessions by opening RStudio, not just the R program.*** The 
default R program is not a very user friendly environment for coding and does 
not work well with R Markdown (.Rmd) files.

### R scripts (.R files) vs. R Markdown files (.Rmd)

When people are performing substantial amounts of R programming, they tend to 
write their code in scripts.  These are files that end in ".R", and they are 
intended to include nothing but code (ideally with some comments as well).

However, R scripts do not provide an easy way to combine regular text and code. 
Sure, you can (and should) add comments to your code to explain what each line 
is doing. But comments are not an easily readable way to include large amounts 
of text. R scripts also do not allow for images, plots, or displays of the 
results of code.

That's where R Markdown comes in.  With a ".Rmd" file, the default
is that you are writing text. However, you can also add code chunks with R code,
and have that code run to generate interesting plots or other outputs.

## Part 2: Indices and column names (5 minutes, instructor will lead)

Let's pull up last week's data very quickly.

```{r}
idaho_wolves <- c(1545, 1556, 1543, 1337)
idaho_years <- c(2019, 2020, 2021, 2022)

idaho <- data.frame(population = idaho_wolves, year = idaho_years)
```

It is often the case that you want to select only a particular column in a 
data frame, or a particular value in a vector. Let's see first, then discuss.


```{r}
idaho_wolves[4]

idaho$year
```

You should note that `idaho_wolves[4]` outputs the 4th value in that vector
(1337).  And that `idaho$year` shows you the entire `year` column in the
data frame `idaho`. 

Let's look at some more complex code.

```{r}
idaho_wolves[1:3]
idaho_wolves[c(1,3)]

idaho$year[2]
idaho[1,2]
```

A few things to unpack. First, we used a very odd function (the `:` operator), 
which is a quick way for R to create a vector that is a sequence of numbers.  
The code tells us to pull the 1st through 3rd entry in our vector. This function 
will often be useful. Try running `7:20`, then try running `10:5`. That's right,
it even works backwards.

Next, if we want to specify several entries, we can't just write 1,3. We need to
make the relevant indices (1 and 3) into a vector as `c(1,3)`. Then we use that
inside our square brackets to find the 1st and 3rd entry.  

Because `idaho$year` is just a vector (from that column's values), we can pick
particular entries in the same way. However, if we have a dataframe, there are
both rows and columns. In that case, you would entry two values/vectors: one 
for the row(s) and one for the column(s). So `idaho[1,2]` gives you the value
from the 1st row and second column.  We won't use this approach much -- there
are more sophisticated tools for selecting parts of our data for tidying or
plotting. 

## Part 3: Index work on your own (10 minutes, on your own)

Here are some new data.

```{r}
#creating a data frame for montana populations through time
mt_wolves <- c(1119, 1107, 1147, 1153, 1181, 1143, 1087)
mt_years <- c(2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022)
montana <- data.frame(population = mt_wolves,
                      year = mt_years,
                      state = c("montana"))

```

We did something cute, and added a third column that just says "montana" in
literally every row. (Nice to keep the state associated with the data
in the other columns.)

Your tasks:

1. Write code to select the 3rd through 5th values in the `mt_wolves` vector.

2. Write code to select the 1st, 2nd, and 6th entry in `mt_years`.

3. Select just the `year` column in the `montana` data frame.

4. Create a new `idaho` data frame that includes a population column, a year
column, and a state column that just says "idaho" in every entry.

```{r}
# all code goes in here



```

## Part 4: Messing around with R Markdown (15 minutes, on your own)

In RStudio, if you click on the Help tab at the top, you will see a selection
labeled "Cheat Sheets".  Select "R Markdown Cheat Sheet", which will download
and open a pdf. This cheat sheet is also posted on Canvas in Files.
I find it a little overwhelming, but here you really
just need to focus on the right side of the first page "Write with Markdown".


This section has instructions about how to format text, create headers, make lists,
etc. Let's try things out.

1. **Knit this document to an html file.** To do this, click on the down 
arrow/triangle just to the right of the "Knit" button that is on the navigation 
bar below the name of the file. A dropdown menu will appear -- click "Knit to 
HTML".  

This should quickly create an html file (like the kinds that represent web 
pages) that you can view. It should include the text, code, plots, and 
formatted LaTeX formulas for population growth. Take a minute to see how 
different parts of the Rmd produced different kind of formatting.

Just above your Rmd file, you should also see a little button that says 
"Visual". If you select that, you can switch to a visual edit which allows for 
easy styling of an Rmd.

2. **Create some headers using the # symbol.** Which one is the biggest? The 
smallest?  You can create headers of six different sizes, from # to ######.

  # Put something here.

### Put something else here.

##### And some more.

3. **Style your text.**

Italicize this sentence.

Bold this sentence.

4. **Create an unordered list** (like bullet points in a powerpoint) of your 
five favorite foods. For one of the foods, add at least two sub-items (perhaps 
those could be specific variations of that food)

5. At the end of the previous section, we manipulated some Montana wolf
data. **Use these numbers to create a table with two columns** (first header
"year", second header "pop. size").



## Wrapping up (5 minutes)

Knit your file to HTML, and save the original Rmd, then add them to your WFC 98 
folder on Google Drive.

## Extra material for interest

* Browse [this article on R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_intro.html). 
Try creating a new .Rmd file and exploring.

* Try adding the option "echo=FALSE" to the top of an R code chunk (see 
the examples in the bottom left on the first page of the R Markdown cheat 
sheet). How does the HTML file look different after you knit the .Rmd file 
again? What about using
"eval=FALSE"?
